Council boundaries and amalgamations,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
*During 2016-17 some local councils were amalgamated or changed boundaries including; ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a) Auburn council was amalgamated into either Cumberland or Parramatta LGAs ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"b) Amalgamation of previous councils into: Bayside, Canterbury-Bankstown, Central Coast, Georges River, Inner West and Northern Beaches",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
c) Part of Hornsby was amalgamated into Parramatta Council,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
**Customers in the Cumberland and Parramatta councils are served by Ausgrid or Endeavour Energy depending on their specific location. This report only includes those customers in Ausgrid's network area,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Electricity usage notes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1. Electricity use data is for the 2017-18 financial year is based on network bills issued up until December 2018 for homes, businesses and other customers in our network area.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2. Electricity use data for all metered low voltage customers has been split into four categories:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i) 'General Supply' refers to electricity used from the grid in residential properties excluding controlled load (off peak) hot water.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ii) 'Off peak hot water' refers primarily to controlled load residential usage primarily from storage hot water systems.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iii) 'Non-residential small-medium sites' refers to non-residential customers supplied at low voltage with annual usage from the grid typically less than 160 MWh per year.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iv) 'Non-residential large sites' refer to non-residential customers supplied at low voltage with annual usage from the grid typically greater than 160 MWh per year.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"3. Unmetered supply consumption is for the street lighting for each local council, with other unmetered supplies allocated to ""Not assigned"" (eg. major road and other unmetered supplies)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"4. ""Not assigned"" customers are customers outside the 32 Local Government Areas listed",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"5. ""High voltage customers"" are large non-residential customers connected at 11 kV or greater (eg. large industry, mining, transport infrastructure, utility infrastructure, some large universities and hospitals).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We have chosen not to release the information for high voltage customers by LGA due to confidentiality concerns,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6. Customer numbers are the average number of customers over the financial year.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7. Solar energy generation is the total electricity exported to the grid from small solar power systems as recorded by electricity meters. The total includes electricity exported from both gross and net metered solar power systems. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Note that this total does not include the solar power used directly within homes with a net metering arrangement.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8. Number of solar customers and solar panel capacity are figures recorded as connected by Ausgrid as at 30 June 2018.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9. Year to year changes are strongly influenced by weather.  Data has not been corrected for weather variations or other factors.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10. Data should be used with caution when comparing with ABS data or other external data sources.  Contact Ausgrid for assistance in interpreting data.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
