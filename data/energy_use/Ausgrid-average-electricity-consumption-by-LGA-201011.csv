Notes:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1. Electricity use data is from billing data for homes, businesses and other customers in our network area.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2. Electricity use data does not include high voltage customers and supply to services such as public lighting and bus shelters.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3. Electricity use data has been split into four categories:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i) 'General Supply' refers to all electricity usage in residential properties except off peak hot water.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ii) 'Off peak hot water' refers primarily to controlled load residential usage from storage hot water systems.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iii) 'Non-residential small sites' refers to non-residential customers supplied at low voltage with usage typically less than 160 MWh per year.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iv) 'Non-residential medium-large sites' refer to non-residential customers supplied at low voltage with usage typically greater than 160 MWh per year.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4. Customer numbers are the average number of customers over the financial year.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5. Solar generation is the total electricity exported to the grid from small solar power systems as recorded by electricity meters. The total includes electricity exported from both gross and net metered solar power systems. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Note that this total does not include the solar power used directly within homes with a net metering arrangement.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6. Year to year changes are strongly influenced by weather.  Data has not been corrected for weather variations or other factors.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7. Data should be used with caution when comparing with ABS data or other external data sources.  Contact Ausgrid for assistance in interpreting data.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
